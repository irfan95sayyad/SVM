ris Flower Classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM)
This project demonstrates a simple implementation of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify Iris flowers into two species: Setosa and Versicolor.

Dataset
The project uses the classic Iris dataset, which contains 150 samples of Iris flowers. Each sample has four features:

Sepal Length (cm)
Sepal Width (cm)
Petal Length (cm)
Petal Width (cm)
For this project, we only use two classes: Setosa and Versicolor.

Model
A linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used for classification. The model is trained on 80% of the data and tested on the remaining 20%.

Results
The model achieves 100% accuracy on the test set, correctly classifying all samples of Setosa and Versicolor.
